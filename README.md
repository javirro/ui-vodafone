# Project description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To manage all async request to the backed I used __tanstack/react-query__ because it facilitates a lot the management of those request.

To include the MAP where devices are shown in the application I used the libraries __react-leaflet__ and __leaflet__. They are an open-source option to add maps to web applications.

For the styles pure CSS is used.

There are test for 2 different components. The Navbar and PageSelector. Test are created using Jest and related packages.

The application was deployed in the following url:
